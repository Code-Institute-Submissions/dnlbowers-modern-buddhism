            There are many beliefs within the Buddhist religion; however, one core subject occurs throughout 
            this philosophy repeatedly: the causes of suffering and how to avoid them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following excerpt is from the book "Transform Your Life" by Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso: - 
        </p>
        <p>
            "All living beings have the same basic wish to be happy and avoid suffering, but very few 
            people understand the real causes of happiness and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            We generally believe that external conditions such as food, friends, cars, and money are 
            the real causes of happiness, and as a result we devote nearly all our time and energy to 
            acquiring these. Superficially it seems that these things can make us happy, but if we look 
            more deeply we shall see that they also bring us a lot of suffering and problems.
        </p>
        <!--image of Guru Sumanti Buddha Heruka wrapped in a figure with fig caption-->
        <figure id="guru-sumanti-fig" class="line-break-below">
            <img src="assets/images/guru-sumanti.png" id="guru-sumanti-img" alt="Image of Guru Sumanti Buddha Heruka">
            <figcaption class="teaching-pg-figcap line-break-below">Guru Sumanti Buddha Heruka</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Happiness and suffering are opposites, so if something is a real cause of happiness it cannot 
            give rise to suffering. If food, money, and so forth really are causes of happiness, they can 
            never be causes of suffering; yet we know from our own experience that they often do cause suffering. 
            For example, one of our main interests is food, but the food we eat is also the principal cause 
            of most of our ill health and sickness.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the process of producing the things we feel will make us happy, we have polluted our environment 
            to such an extent that the very air we breathe and the water we drink now threaten our health and 
            well-being. We love the freedom and independence a car can give us, but the cost in accidents and 
            environmental destruction is enormous. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We feel that money is essential for us to enjoy life, but the pursuit of money also causes immense 
            problems and anxiety. Even our family and friends, with whom we enjoy so many happy moments, can 
            also bring us a lot of worry and heartache.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years our understanding and control of the external world have increased considerably, 
            and as a result we have witnessed remarkable material progress; but there has not been a corresponding 
            increase in human happiness. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no less suffering in the world today, and there are no fewer problems. Indeed, it could be 
            said that there are now more problems and greater unhappiness than ever before. This shows that the 
            solution to our problems, and to those of society as a whole, does not lie in knowledge or control of 
            the external world.
        </p>
        <!--image of Buddha Maitreya wrapped in a figure with fig caption-->
        <figure id="buddha-maitreya-fig" class="line-break-below">
            <img src="assets/images/buddha-maitreya.png" id="buddha-maitreya-img" alt="Image of Buddha Maitreya">
            <figcaption class="teaching-pg-figcap line-break-below">Buddha Maitreya</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Why is this? Happiness and suffering are states of mind, and so their main causes cannot be found 
            outside the mind. The real source of happiness is inner peace. If our mind is peaceful, we shall 
            be happy all the time, regardless of external conditions, but if it is disturbed or troubled in any 
            way, we shall never be happy, no matter how good our external conditions may be.
        </p>
        <p>
            External conditions can only make us happy if our mind is peaceful. We can understand this through 
            our own experience. For instance, even if we are in the most beautiful surroundings and have 
            everything we need, the moment we get angry any happiness we may have disappears. This is because 
            anger has destroyed our inner peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see from this that if we want true, lasting happiness we need to develop and maintain a 
            special experience of inner peace. The only way to do this is by training our mind through 
            spiritual practice – gradually reducing and eliminating our negative, disturbed states of 
            mind and replacing them with positive, peaceful states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, through continuing to improve our inner peace we shall experience permanent 
            inner peace, or ‘nirvana’. Once we have attained nirvana we shall be happy throughout 
            our life, and in life after life. We shall have solved all our problems and accomplished 
            the true meaning of our human life."
