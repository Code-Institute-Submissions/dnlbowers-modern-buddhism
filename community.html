        <h2>International Community</h2>
        <p>
            The New Kadampa Tradition has a vibrant community across the globe. 
            Through the international Temples project, they aim to have a Kadampa 
            Temple in every major city worldwide. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Should you wish to spend some time experiencing the community and what 
            it is like to be amongst like-minded people, I highly recommend attending 
            one of their international festivals or even booking into one of their centres 
            for a working holiday.

                <h3>International Festivals</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three international festivals per year. The traditions mother centre 
                    in the lake district hosts two of these over the spring and summer seasons. The third festival 
                    then moves around to a different international location every fall.  
                </p>  
                <p>
                    These festivals usually have over 3000 attendees gathering 
                    from across the globe in one place for a meaningful holiday. There is no 
                    obligation to work at a festival; however, it is run entirely by volunteers 
                    should you be the sort who likes to keep busy whilst making new friends.
                </p>     
                <p>
                    The teachings are provided in English and translated into multiple languages 
                    via headsets.  You can book translation with one easy click during the booking stage.
