            The quote above requires further explanation to make sense to those who are yet 
            to explore the tradition themselves. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso states book "Transform

            and, in this context, refers to the potential transformation of one's mind that can be received 
            by turning to the teachings taught by Buddha.

                Should you wish to spend some time experiencing the community and what 
                it is like to be amongst like-minded people, I highly recommend attending 
                one of their international festivals or even booking into one of their centers 
                for a working holiday.

                <p>
                    The New Kadampa Tradition holds three primary festivals per year. Manjushri Meditation Center, 
                    located in the Lake District, is considered the hub of the New Kadampa 
                    Tradition and hosts two of the three international festivals between the 
                    spring and summer seasons. The third festival then moves around to a different 
                    global location every fall.  
                </p>  
                <p>
                    These festivals usually have over 3000 attendees gathering 
                    from across the globe in one place for a meaningful holiday. There is no 
                    obligation to work at a festival; however, it is run entirely by volunteers 
                    should you be the sort who likes to keep busy whilst making new friends.
                </p>     
                <p>
                    The teachings are provided in English and translated into multiple languages 
                    via headsets.  You can book translation with one easy click during the booking stage.  
                </p>

                    There are also smaller, more regional festivals throughout the year.

                <p>
                    Kadampa Meditation Centers take a lot of effort to maintain. Centers around the world are usually 
                    open to offering free accommodation, food and classes to anyone willing to spend 
                    a week or two living within the center whilst helping out with the various activities 
                    required to run it. You even get plenty of time off to explore the geographical location 
                    during your evenings and weekends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conditions and tasks would vary according to the center's needs. Should you wish to 
                    learn more about this, you can use the center locator on 
                    <a href="https://kadampa.org/centers-modern-buddhism" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens a new tab on the kadampa meditation center locator page of kadampa.org">kadampa.org</a> 
                    and contact the desired center directly to ask about availabilities for working holidays and what that would look like at 
                    their center.

                    Please note that due to covid restrictions, some centers may currently be unable to offer 
                    working holidays. Despite this,  I am sure they would welcome the opportunity to connect 
                    with you via email and discuss any plans you may want to make for the future or even settle 
                    any curiosities you may have regarding the tradition.
