        <p>
            The New Kadampa Tradition has a vibrant community across the globe that has been expanding 
            year after year. This community is termed "Sangha", and it is a group of spiritual friends  
            who are there to help guide and support you along the path to peace and enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the international Temples project, the New Kadampa Tradition aim to have a Kadampa 
            Temple in every major city worldwide, making the teachings of Buddha available readily to 
            people of this modern world.

                Should you wish to spend some time experiencing the community and what 
                it is like to be amongst like-minded people, I highly recommend attending 
                one of their international festivals or even booking into one of their centers 
                for a working holiday.

                        The New Kadampa Tradition holds three primary festivals per year. Manjushri Meditation Center, 
                        located in the Lake District, is considered the hub of the New Kadampa 
                        Tradition and hosts two of the three international festivals between the 
                        spring and summer seasons. The third festival then moves around to a different 
                        global location every fall.  
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        These festivals usually have over 3000 attendees gathering 
                        from across the globe in one place for a meaningful holiday. There is no 
                        obligation to work at a festival; however, it is run entirely by volunteers 
                        should you be the sort who likes to keep busy whilst making new friends.
                    </p>     
                    <p>
                        The teachings are provided in English and translated into multiple languages 
                        via headsets.  You can book translation with one easy click during the booking stage.  
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        There are also smaller, more regional festivals throughout the year.

                        Kadampa Meditation Centers take a lot of effort to maintain. Centers around the world are usually 
                        open to offering free accommodation, food and classes to anyone willing to spend 
                        a week or two living within the center whilst helping out with the various activities 
                        required to run it. You even get plenty of time off to explore the geographical location 
                        during your evenings and weekends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The conditions and tasks would vary according to the center's needs. Should you wish to 
                        learn more about this, you can use this 
                        <a href="https://kadampa.org/centers-modern-buddhism" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens a new tab on the kadampa meditation center locator page of kadampa.org">center locator tool</a> 
                        on Kadampa.org and contact the desired center directly to ask about availabilities for working holidays and what that would look like at 
                        their center.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that due to covid restrictions, some centers may currently be unable to offer 
                        working holidays. Despite this,  I am sure they would welcome the opportunity to connect 
                        with you via email and discuss any plans you may want to make for the future or even settle 
                        any curiosities you may have regarding the tradition.
