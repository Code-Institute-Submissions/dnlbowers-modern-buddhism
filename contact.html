        <p>
            The best way to contact the New Kadampa Tradition would be to look up your nearest point of contact via the 
            <a href="https://kadampa.org/centers-modern-buddhism" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens a new tab directly on the center locator pager of Kadampa.org">center locator</a> 
            page on Kadampa.org. You could either look up a class time to attend or see if they have a "World Peace Cafe" to which you can informally 
            drop in and enjoy a coffee whilst meeting volunteers and residents of the local center.
        </p>
        <!-- The anchor tag below is internal, I chose to open it in a new tab so the user keeps the contact page open to return to -->
        <p>
            However, if like me you have no community yet in your area, all is not lost. For inspiration and resources, you can follow the New Kadampa Tradition on social media pages linked at the <a href="#footer">bottom of this page</a>
            or use the methods described under the heading "<a href="community.html#ways-to-connect" target=_blank aria-label="opens this sites community page in a new tab">Ways To Connect In Person</a>" 
            provided on this site's Community page for a more "hands-on" experience of the tradition.

            If you do not feel ready to reach out to an organization, you can also reach out to me directly 
            via the form below for a more informal connection. Below is a short bio about me and my experience 
            within the New Kadampa Tradition.

        <!-- Short introduction to the site author -->
        <h3 class="main-heading line-break-top-bottom"> About the site author</h3>
        <p>
            My name is David, and to the best of my knowledge I am the only practitioner 
            of this tradition here in Malta. The purpose of the site is intended as 
            and introduction to those who have no prior knowledge of the New Kadampa Tradition
            and are interested in more information.
        </p>  
        <p>   
            I have studied the tradition for the past 15 years. Along the way, I have 
            taught meditation, attended a number of international festivals and lived 
            within a number of their centers to the point of taking on a management role 
            whilst being resident.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Please note that whilst I have been authorized to teach by the tradition in the past, this
            is not currently the case. Teachers within the NKT must attend specific study programmes themselves 
            in order to remain qualified to teach and it has been a number of years since I have last attended 
            this kind of programme.</em> 
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said I am happy to discuss the subject at length with anyone who is willing.
            If you are interested in learning more, want an outlet to discuss what you know, or 
            would like notifications on any news related to the tradition via a newsletter, please fill 
            out the relevant parts of the form below, and let's stay in touch.
