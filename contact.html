        <h2 class="main-heading">How to contact the New Kadampa Tradition</h2>
        <p>
            The best way to contact the New Kadampa Tradition would be to look up your nearest point of contact via the 
            <a href="https://kadampa.org/centers-modern-buddhism" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens a new tab directly on the center locator pager of Kadampa.org">center locator</a> 
            page on Kadampa.org. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You could either look up a class time to attend or see if they have a "World Peace Cafe" to which you can informally 
            drop in and enjoy a coffee whilst meeting volunteers and residents of the local center.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if there is no community yet in your area, all is not lost. For inspiration and resources, you can follow the New Kadampa Tradition on social media pages linked at the <a href="#footer">bottom of this page</a>
            or use the methods described under the heading <a href="community.html" target=_blank aria-label="opens the sites community page in a new tab">"Ways To Connect To The Global Community"</a> 
            provided on this site's Community page for a more "hands-on" experience of the tradition.

        <h3 class="main-heading">Contact Me For Malta Meet Ups</h3>
        <p>
            Although there is no formal link to the New Kadampa Tradition here in Malta, 
            I have studied the tradition for the past 15 years. Along the way, I have 
            taught meditation, attended international festivals and lived in a number 
            of their centers to the point of taking on a management role whilst being a resident.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst I have taught classes on the traditions general programme, I am no longer a teacher 
            within the tradition. I am looking to gather like-minded people in Malta so we can eventually 
            submit the request for a qualified teacher to be sent here to the island. 
        </p>
