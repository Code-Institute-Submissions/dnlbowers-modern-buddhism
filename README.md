# Modern Buddhism

This website introduces people to a modern form of Buddhism without any cultural influence from the east. The ultimate intention is to attract those craving to be happy yet have failed to find the answers outside of themselves in the world around them. It is helpful to those who want to learn more about the New Kadampa Tradition and wish to seek out further free resources online or connect directly with one of the already pre-existing communities worldwide.

At the end of the content, there is an embedded anchor tag so they can download a free copy of one of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's books in electronic format to read on their phone or their kindle.

This image is Geshe Kelsang Gyatso sat on what is commonly called a throne at one of the traditions international festivals. The throne is where a teacher sits to expound the oral lineage past from teacher to disciple, and so it was appropriate for a page discussing the core beliefs of the philosophy in his own words.

This quote is the first line of the provided exert from "Transform your Life", the book available to download for free. The intention is to set the tone for the following teaching within the content, explaining Buddhism's core belief.

### Content
This page includes an exert from the downloadable e-book. It covers the core beliefs behind what Buddhism teaches. I have purposely kept it to the most relatable teachings to those looking to improve their mental health. There are more esoteric aspects within the belief system of Buddhism; however, they are not necessary to adopt to gain benefit from the teachings. This extract from the book "Transform Your Life" summarizes the core value that all problems arise from within us. 

I have included some images to break up the monotony of the long passage and illustrate its meaning. The initial image does not add meaning to the text and so was added via CSS. The image is symbolic of the traditions, linage and teachings and is used purely as decoration.
