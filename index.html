        <h2>What is modern buddhism.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Modern Buddhism is a method that easily integrates a technique dating back over 2600 years into the complexities of our everyday life. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Since the appearance of Buddha Shakyamuni (commonly known as Buddha), the external conditions of life has changed dramatically, but what about the internal conditions?  Internal refers to our state of mind. Human emotions have remained unchanged throughout history, as can be seen by wars caused by hatred, ignorance and greed.  The world at large has never experienced for long a time of peace.</p>
        <br>
        <p>"But this is the world, not me! I am not like that; I hate war!" or "or war is necessary to avert the evil of other people", and this may well be true. The war example is extreme to illustrate the general suffering of the human condition. Let us break this down on a more personal level.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're at work; there is a big promotion on the cards. You know you're going to get it. Heck, everyone knows you're going to get it! You have been there the longest, work the hardest, advise all your colleagues on their work. It has to be to you, doesn't it?  What if the person who got the role was actually a colleague, one you introduced to the company after you started. You even trained up despite the fact you found them hard to deal with. They were so slow to understand after all. </p>
        <br>
        <p>You have spent weeks building up this idea that you would be strolling into the office soon wearing your big boss suit and tie. But when the time came, you discover that everyone is congratulating someone else around the coffee machine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>How does this make you feel? Of course, I cannot generalise this to everyone, but it would be safe to say that this would spark some form of unpleasant feeling in many of us. You may want to change jobs or even lash out at the undeserving candidate. Maybe you run away to cry into a cup of tea with a duvet over your head, wondering if there is any ice cream left in the freezer.  Either way, the resulting disappointment was likely an experience you would rather avoid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The above example can be translated into any situation where we were chasing something we wanted and failed. It could be that someone else we feel is inferior to ourselves got that which we desire, but the point is that unpleasant feelings are a common experience in life. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I think it is fair to say most of us would strive to avoid these feelings, but is this realistic? Unlikely, since we cannot control every variable in our lives, so what is the solution? Modern Buddhism teaches us to change our point of view and helps us find the kind of unshakable peace that comes from within. Bad things will happen, and the only control you can genuinely develop is over your own mind. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Modern Buddhism is a method with which we can learn to do this. It lays out a blueprint showing us the source of our suffering and provides multiple antidotes to reduce and eventually eradicate the nightmare coming from within our own minds.</p>
